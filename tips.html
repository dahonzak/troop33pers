  <h1>Tips</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>Weather</h3>
  Weather is one of the main concerns for you to worry about. There have been times where on training hikes we have had to prepare for 80 degree weather as well as 10 degree weather. But thats just temperture it can also rain, hail, snow, and other unexpected things. On our spring break hike we had all sort of weather starting with hail and snow and ending with lightning storms. Even at philmont in the middle of the summer we had a hail storm with wind gusts reaching 60+ mph and lightning too. Some of our tents almost collapsed in that storm with us in them.<b> At Philmont you can expect bad weather every after noon 12-ish sometimes earlier (rain and various other storms).</b>

  <h3>Water</h3>
  We recommend getting a water filter and large water storage containers. Iodine, take some on the training hikes it tastes bad but its water and you can dilute it with drink mix. Otherwise you will spend time boiling water (trust me not fun).  At philmont you will get chlorine pills make sure to keep them in one piece. <br><br>

  <h3>Food</h3>
  Food is important do not save it unless its not an essential meal item. At philmont at every camp go to the swap box immediately and swap for highest caloary count (usually yummy). Get rid of chick peas and sesamme seeds they taste terrible.

  <h3>Fuel</h3>
  For training hikes bring white gas stoves because of unexpected weather. To philmont we recommend butane it cooks mutch faster and is easier for transport. Always bring spare canisters.
  <h3>Tent Placement</h3>
  Find a spot that is flat, smooth, away from watersheds, and away from percarious trees. This brings us to camp fly. With the camp fly use trekking poles to prop the sides out to create more space and a more stable tent that directs the water away on inclines.

  <h3>Packing</h3>
  <h4>Clothes</h4>
 &emsp; Bring layers and synthetic clothes or wool.
  &emsp;<h4>Food</h4>
  &emsp;Leave a basketball size of space in your pack for food. (make it work) At Philmount you will be carrying up to 5 days 3 meals of food at a time. 
  &emsp;<h4>Crew Gear</h4>
  &emsp;Always leave room for crew gear theres a lot of it.
 &emsp; <h4>Weight</h4>
  Try to reduce weight as much as possible, at philmont some of our crew members had 20 pound bags but people like me who were not ultralight had over 40 (painful). 
  <h3>Laundry</h3>
  Pick a day that has no activiies on it to do laundry. Use 2 gallon ziplock bags and camp suds to clean your clothes. Laundry is great you can get the grime from under fingernails and on your hands gone.<br><br><img src='https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-bQX6jmm/0/X2/i-bQX6jmm-X2.jpg' width='400px' />

  <h3>Navigation</h3>
  On the training hikes many of the maps are not perfect and a lot of trails are not marked or abandoned to the point where you cannot tell them appart from the rest of the forest. At Philmont pay attention to stream crossings and countour lines on map. Inform the rest of your party. If you want to know the distance between two camps count the square kilometers following your path and multiply by 0.62 and add 1 or two miles depending on how great the elevation change is.
  <h3>Doing your Buissness</h3>
  At Philmont you will have red roof inns and such things for going number 2. But while on the training hikes dig a hole as deep as your troul and use minimum amount of paper and cover up make sure you are 100 ft from a stream.<br><br>

  <h3>Trust/Support</h3>
  Help each other do not be lazy. Follow instructions from those who are leading (do not do so blindly though). Morale will be your greatest obstacle and your highest card. Be freindly, be open, talk, and try to foster freindship even if you really dont want it.  <br><br>

  Make sure to pack everything you brought in out and leave the space as you first found it so others can enjoy.
